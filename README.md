# ROS_vscode_extension
 VS Code extension to aid in developing ROS2 projects

## Development setup

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build the extension: `npm run compile`
3. Start debugging from VS Code (`Run Extension` launch config).

Notes:
- The extension entrypoint is `out/extension.js`.
- `npm install` also triggers a compile step automatically.
